Experimental - Building fully functionable JAVA SE based media player.

This is experimental repo which contains a small to medium project building fully functionable Java FX media player which uses JFX Media Player as a main, and JVLC player as a fallback Media Player option.
I'll be using various design patterns to achieve this, but most of the implementation is just a personal opinion, which might not be the best solution.
I've started working on this project a long time ago, and never had time to really finish it.

Hopefully I will find some free time soon to continue work on it.
